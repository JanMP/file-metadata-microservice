# File Metadata Microservice 2
A practice assignment for [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). Please 
refer to [this page] for the assignment.

### Why the number 2?
I didn't think, when I started working on this assignment and blindly followed
the instructions to set up the project with ClementineJS. Since you don't need
Database access in this assignment, It would have been much cleaner (and also less
trouble) to do that little bit of express scripting from scratch (like I had already
done on the first two assignments).

So I started fresh. That's the reason for the "2" in
the project name.
